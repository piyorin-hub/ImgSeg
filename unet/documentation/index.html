    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    
<p>This dataset contains a collection of 785 pedestrian cutouts from
228 images (1176x640 pixels) captured with a stereo camera from on-board a vehicle. <br>
</p>
<p>For each cutout we provide a 24 bit png color image, disparity
values (comma separated float values) and a ground truth annotation in
form of a 1 bit png image (0=background, 1(255)=pedestrian).</p>
<p>To avoid negative border effects we provide the cutouts extended by
10% of width (of the original bounding box) to the left and right, and
10% of height (of the original bounding box) to the top and bottom.<br>
</p>

<p>Sequences are split into test, validation and complete data. Be
aware that we used only the test and validation data in our
publication! For installation, simply extract the provided <i>.tar.gz</i> archives. This will create the folders </p><pre>data/testData (contains all used cutouts for testing, 300 cutouts bigger than 120 pixels in height)<br></pre> <pre>data/validationData (contains all used cutouts for validation, 30 cutouts bigger than 120 pixels in height)</pre>
  <p></p>
<pre>data/completeData (contains the whole dataset, 785 cutouts).<br></pre>

<h2>Camera Parameters</h2>

    Provided images have been rectified. Camera parameters necessary to project from 2D to 3D are described in the file:
    <pre>calibration/camera_parameters.txt</pre>
    
    
<p>
The camera is mounted inside the vehicle below the rear view mirror.
The world coordinate system origin is below the rear axis of the
vehicle on the ground-plane. x is pointing to the right, y is pointing
up and z is pointing towards the driving direction. The camera is 1.2m
above the ground and 1.9m behind the front of the vehicle. Distance of
the camera to the rear axis is 1.8m.<br>

    <h2>Benchmarking Procedure</h2>
    
<p>Authors who wish to evaluate pedestrian segmentation on this dataset are encouraged
      to follow the benchmarking procedure and criteria as detailed in the publication given
      above. <br>
We use the intersection/union criterium of the PASCAL VOC challenge [2].<br>
 
    </p>

    <p>
      The original authors would like to hear about other publications that
      make use of the benchmark data set in order to include corresponding 
      references on the benchmark website.<br>
