# Camera parameters

# The camera is mounted inside the vehicle below the rear view mirror.

# on the ground-plane. x is pointing to the right, y is pointing up and z
# is pointing towards the driving direction.

# The camera is 1.2m above the ground and 1.9m behind the front of the vehicle.
# Distance of the camera to the rear axis is 1.8m.
